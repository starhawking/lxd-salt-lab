# Items to build a salt-reclass lab

This repository contains a variety of tools that I've been using to build a lab for my colleagues to learn salt-reclass.

Ansible is used to prepare the actual lab environment. There are currently playbooks for installing salt packages on the master and minions, as well as creating several lxd containers.
